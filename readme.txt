MY CONSTRUCT WEEK EXPERIENCE

Apr 1, 2022.
           I was assigned a project a week ago i.e on 24th March 2022(Friday). I was the async student at Masai, so In this unit we were supposed
           to create a clone of website all by ourself. My personal experience for this week was very exhauting.
           I made a lot of mistakes in the initial days of the assignment. Till Monday I unknowingly created the wrong home page and footer.
           And on Monday, I got this localhost error(127.0.0.1) , which I have no clue how to resolve and it wasn't an internet issue for sure.
           Most of the good part started from Tuesday, Next day the localhost error automatically went away without any 
           changes.

           I started working on Tuesday finally. Worked through the home page of Pluralsight,it asked for a lot of designing
           a lot. Worked for the whole day. i.e 10am to 11pm had a couple of breaks in between. Then again for the following days
           till Friday i.e the submission date worked the same. 
           It was very exhausting experience but as right now I am righting this blog, I dont know why it feels exhausted but 
           at the same time some next level satisfaction.It feels great now.

           Now, lets come to the technical part, I used javascript, Html,CSS tools to create this platform, Also I added ssome
           animations(Took the help of youtube). I created a detail page which consist of your complete information for registeration
           and also includes payment details.With the help the registered information, you can also login and password is 
           always your lastname just for yur convienience.
           
           If you would ask me, if it could have been done better? Of course I could have done better.
           I feel satisfied and at the same time. Hoping to learn from mistakes.

           Thank you.
